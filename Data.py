The Cold War was an intense, eleven-year galactic geopolitical tensions between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire and their respective allies after 3653 BBY. The Treaty of Coruscant ended the Great Galactic War, sealing the Sith Empire's partial victory and its annexation of almost two thirds of the known galaxy. Peace was gained, but tensions between the Empire and the Republic remained high, especially as the Empire began seizing more planets in the Core Worlds. In the ten years after the war, fear and uncertainty gripped the galaxy. Border skirmishes and proxy wars between the Empire and Republic erupted, and the uneasy truce between the two foes appeared to be on the verge of collapse, as it finally did in 3642 BBY.
The eleven year period during which the Cold War took place was perhaps one of the most significant periods in galactic history, particularly for that of the Sith. As a result of the immense power that they held during the Cold War, this was well-regarded as having been the time in which the Sith were at their mightiest.
